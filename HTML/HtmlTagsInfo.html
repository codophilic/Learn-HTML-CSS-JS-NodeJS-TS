<!-- Adding Images in web page 
Attributes of the <img> Tag - self closing tag
src (source): Specifies the path to the image file. This can be a relative path, an absolute path, or a URL to an external image.
alt (alternative text): Provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed. This is important for accessibility and for search engines to understand the content of the image.
width: Specifies the width of the image (in pixels or as a percentage).
height: Specifies the height of the image (in pixels or as a percentage).
title: Provides additional information about the image, typically displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
loading: Indicates how the browser should load the image (lazy for lazy loading, eager for loading immediately).

<!-- Block and Inline Elements
Block Elements: 
- Block-level elements typically start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them. They create "blocks" of content on a web page. 
- Some common block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, and more. 

Key Characteristics of Block-Level Elements:
- They typically start on a new line.
- They occupy the full width available to them by default (unless specified otherwise).
- You can set the width, height, margin, and padding properties.
- They can contain other block-level and inline elements.

Inline Elements:
- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary. 
- They flow alongside adjacent elements (if there's space) and do not disrupt the flow of the surrounding content. Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <button>, and more.

Key Characteristics of Inline Elements:
- They do not start on a new line; they flow inline with the rest of the content.
- They occupy only as much width as necessary.
- You can't set the width and height properties (though you can set padding and margin on some).
- They can contain other inline elements and text.

When to use?
Block-Level Elements: 
- Use block-level elements when you want to create distinct sections or blocks of content that start on new lines and typically occupy the full width available.

Inline Elements: 
- Use inline elements when you want to style smaller parts of text or elements that should flow inline with surrounding content, like links (<a>), emphasis (<em>), or spans of text with specific styles.

Block Elements
<p style="background-color: aqua;">Took whole width</p>
<div style="background-color: bisque;"> Took whole width </div>
<h2 style="background-color: bisque;"> Took whole width </h2>

Inline Elements
<span style="background-color: blue;">Hello</span><span style="background-color: blueviolet;">World</span>


<!-- Adding Hyperlink in web page
- Adding hyperlinks (or links) to a web page in HTML is done using the <a> (anchor) element. 
- To create a basic hyperlink that directs users to another web page or resource, use the <a> element with the href attribute:
- To open a link in a new browser tab or window, use the target="_blank" attribute
- You can also create links that navigate to different sections of the same web page using the id attribute
- You can also redirect to a url by clicking on image
- Using anchor tag we can redirect to our own html files
-->
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Example Website</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>

<!-- 
Semantic Tags
- Semantic tags in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. They provide context to the content they enclose. Some common semantic tags include:
<header>: Represents introductory content at the beginning of a section or webpage. Typically contains headings, logos, navigation menus, etc.
<nav>: Defines a section of navigation links. Used for menus, tables of contents, etc.
<main>: Specifies the main content of the document. Should not be nested within <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav>.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Used to divide content into sections that can be styled or manipulated as a unit.
<article>: Represents a complete, or self-contained, piece of content that could stand independently. Examples include blog posts, news articles, comments, etc.
<aside>: Defines content aside from the content it is placed in. Often used for sidebars or tangentially related content.
<footer>: Represents a footer for its nearest section or the document. Typically contains information about the author, copyright data, contact information, etc.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Used together to mark up self-contained content, such as images, diagrams, illustrations, etc., with a caption.

Structural Elements
- Structural elements in HTML are non-semantic elements that help organize the layout and structure of a web page. They include:
<div>: A generic container for grouping elements. Used for styling purposes and to group elements for styling or scripting.
<span>: A generic inline container for grouping inline elements. Similar to <div>, but for inline content.
<section>, <article>, <aside>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>: These are both semantic and structural elements, as they provide structure to the document while also conveying their specific meaning.

Structural Elements just define the structure of HTML page but it does not help browsers to render what kind of the data is present.
Semantic tags not only define the structure of HTML page but it also help browsers to understand of kind of data is to be presented, how importance the data is, which is navigation and which are main contents etc.

While there is overlap between semantic tags and structure elements, the distinct advantages of semantic HTML—improved accessibility, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) benefits, clearer code structure, and adherence to best practices—justify their use and separate existence. By leveraging semantic tags appropriately, you enhance the usability and maintainability of your web pages while ensuring they are accessible to all users and well-understood by search engines.

<!--
Collapse Content using Details and Summary tag
- The <summary> and <details> tags in HTML are used together to create a collapsible and expandable section of content, often referred to as an "accordion" or "collapsible panel". 
- This feature allows you to hide content behind a summary or heading, revealing it only when the user chooses to interact with it.

<details> Tag
- The <details> tag is used to specify a disclosure widget or a nested set of disclosure widgets. 
- It represents a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information or controls. The content of the <details> element is initially hidden and can be shown or hidden by the user.

<!-- Create Table 
HTML Table Tags
<table>: This tag defines a table container that holds all the table elements.

<caption>: Optional. Provides a title or caption for the table.

<thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>: These tags group the table rows (<tr>) into three main sections:

<thead>: Contains the header rows of the table.
<tbody>: Contains the main content rows of the table.
<tfoot>: Contains the footer rows of the table.
<tr>: Defines a table row. It contains one or more <th> or <td> elements.

<th>: Defines a header cell in a table. It's typically used within <thead> but can also be used within <tbody> or <tfoot> for special headers.

<td>: Defines a standard data cell in a table. It represents each individual cell of data in the table.

When we include styles we get proper border line and padding details just like a table structure

<!-- Forms in HTML
An HTML form is used to collect user input, such as text input, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons, which can then be sent to a server for processing. Here’s an overview of HTML form tags and their usage, along with an example of a login page:

HTML Form Tags
<form>: Defines the beginning and end of an HTML form.
<input>: Represents an interactive control in an HTML form, such as text input, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
<label>: Defines a label for an <input> element.
<button>: Defines a clickable button, typically used to submit the form data to the server.
<select>: Creates a dropdown list.
<option>: Defines an option in a dropdown list (<select>).
<textarea>: Defines a multiline input control (text area) for text input.
<fieldset>: Groups related elements in a form and provides a border and optional legend.
<legend>: Defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) supports several methods for communicating between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. Two common methods used in web development are GET and POST. These methods differ in how they handle and transmit data, and they can affect the structure of the URL.

GET Method
Usage: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.
Data Transmission: Data is appended to the URL as parameters (key=value pairs) in the query string.
Visible: Parameters are visible to everyone in the URL.
Security: Not suitable for sensitive data (like passwords), as they are visible in the URL.
Idempotent: Operations are idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.
Cacheable: Responses can be cached by browsers and intermediaries.

POST Method
Usage: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
Data Transmission: Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not visible in the URL.
Security: Suitable for sensitive data, as it does not appear in the URL.
Not Idempotent: Operations are not idempotent; repeating the same request may have different effects.
Not Cacheable: Responses are typically not cached, although caching is possible with proper headers.

When to Use Each Method
GET:
Use GET when the request is safe and idempotent (repeating the request has no additional effect).
Use for retrieving data from the server.
Use for requests that can be cached.
Use when parameters can be added to the URL for bookmarking or sharing.
POST:
Use POST when the request has side effects (such as updating data).
Use for submitting forms with sensitive data (like passwords).
Use when the amount of data is large (since there are no size limitations on POST data).

URL Impact
GET: Parameters are visible in the URL's query string, affecting readability and potentially bookmarking.
POST: Parameters are not visible in the URL, which can enhance security for sensitive data.

The action attribute usually specifies a URL where the form data is submitted. 
This URL can point to a server-side script written in languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, etc., 
or it can be an API endpoint that processes the submitted data or html file like success or failure
